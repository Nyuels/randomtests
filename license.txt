Source code under the net.stamfest.randomtests.nist package 
-----------------------------------------------------------

The source code under the net.stamfest.randomtests.nist package
is derived from source code released by NIST, namely from the downloaded
file sts-2.1.1.zip

The original code seems to be covered by a BSD style license (although this 
is not entirely clear, IANAL), but under this assumption this license covers 
the code which is the base for the stuff under net.stamfest.randomtests.nist 

Test classes and test-data may also include NIST data taken from either 
the NIST publication of from the original sources. Some other test data
was produced using the original C-based NIST software interactively.

All this being said: I do not want to infringe on any NIST rights and I want
this version to be able to be redistributed as far as possible.  

Note: For other licenses covering parts of the code: read on

This is the original license as found in the NIST code file src/assess.c:
